# Reduced-Representation-Workshop
This is a repository for a one day bioinformatics workshop on reduced representation genome sequencing

## Bakcground
Many interesting organisms have big genomes, making complete genome sequencing infeasible, especially for multiple individuals.  A relatively cost-efficient solution has been developed recently called "reduced representation genome sequencing" (RRGS).  This approach enables deep sequencing of multiple genetic samples from the same (homologous) genomic regions.  It takes advantage of next generation (Illumina) sequencing technology and requires relatively simple laboratory efforts such as DNA extraction, whcih can be accomplished with a centrifuge and a heat block.  Other laboratory steps (library construction) can be outsourced or done in house, depending on the equipment and funds that are available. This approach has many applications, including phylogenomics, population genomics, linkage mapping, and analysis of gene flow.

## Goals
The goal of this workshop is to introduce students to RRGS, including how various approaches differ and advantages and disadvantages of differnet approaches.

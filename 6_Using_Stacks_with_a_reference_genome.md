# Using Stacks with a reference genome

(Or you can go back to using a bask script [here](https://github.com/evansbenj/Reduced-Representation-Workshop/blob/master/5_Automating_alignment_with_a_bash_script.md).

Stacks us a software suite that compiles reduced representation genome sequencing data first witih each individual in your analysis, and then across individuals.  It can calculate summary statistics from your data and also output your results in useful formats that other programs can take as input.

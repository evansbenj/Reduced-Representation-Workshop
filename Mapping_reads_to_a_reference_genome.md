# Mapping Reads to a Reference Genome

Depending on your organism of study, there may or may not be a relatively closely related genome sequence to work with.  Depending on your research question, this may or may not be useful.  In our example study on Tonkean macaques, we are ultimately interested in quantifying molecular polymorphism on the X chromosome and comparing it to polymorphism on the autosomes.  For this reason, the genomic location of the data is crucial and we can benefit from the complete genome sequence of a closely related species of macaque monkey, the rhesus macaque.  We will use a program called `bwa`, which is available [here] (http://sourceforge.net/projects/bio-bwa/files)

# Basic Unix use

All of the software in this workshop is available for free and runs on a Unix operating system.  In order to use these applications, we need to know/review a few basic commands that will allow us to move through directories, copy and edit files, and see what is in a directory.

To connect to the Unix system we are using, do this (to be edited later):

To see what directory you are in, type this:
`pwd`
and then hit `return`.

This should print out the home directory.  Each backslash indicates the name of a directory.
